## ðŸŽ¨ Blog Image Generation

This project includes an automatic blog post image generator that uses DALL-E 3 to create beautiful, relevant header images for your blog posts. To use this feature:

1. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Get an API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) and add it to your `.env` file:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```

3. Run the image generator:
   ```sh
   npm run generate-blog-images
   ```

The generator will:
- Skip posts that already have custom images
- Generate new images for posts with placeholder images or no images
- Save the images to your public directory
- Automatically update the post's frontmatter

Generated images are:
- 1792x1024 pixels (optimal for blog headers)
- Professional and minimalist in style
- Relevant to each post's title
- Saved with SEO-friendly filenames

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
